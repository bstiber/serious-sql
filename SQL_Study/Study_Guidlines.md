# Dual-purpose study guide 

`that (1) locks knowledge into your brain through recall and (2) can later be turned into shareable content without much rewriting.`

## 1️⃣ The Learn → Recall → Teach Cycle

This works because you’re testing yourself before looking at the answer, then reframing it for an audience.

Step 1 – Learn it briefly
	•	Watch or read your learning material (Neal Davis, Loreso, Mo Chen, etc.).
	•	Avoid over-highlighting. Your goal is just enough understanding to attempt recall.

Step 2 – Close the source and Recall
	•	In your own words, try to answer:
	1.	What does it do?
	2.	When do you use it?
	3.	What’s a simple example?
	•	Don’t worry if you forget — that’s where the learning happens.

Step 3 – Teach it to a “future audience”
	•	Immediately write a short, content-style explanation (as if you’re tweeting or making a LinkedIn tip).
	•	Keep examples practical, not textbook.
	•	You now have study notes and draft content at the same time.

2️⃣ Your Study Guide Structure

You can build this in Notion (or Google Docs if you prefer) with these fields:

Command / Concept	My Recall	Example	Common Mistakes	Memory Trick / Analogy	Content Draft
SELECT	Retrieves specific columns from a table	SELECT name FROM employees;	Forgetting to specify columns	“SELECT is like ordering items from a menu — you only get what you list.”	“💡 SQL Tip: SELECT is your shopping list for data…”
*	Selects all columns	SELECT * FROM employees;	Using in production when unnecessary	“The * is like saying ‘give me everything in the store’”	“Want everything in your table? Use SELECT * — but…”
FROM	Chooses the table to pull from	SELECT name FROM employees;	Misspelling table names	“FROM is like telling the waiter which kitchen to get your food from”	…
LIMIT	Restricts number of rows returned	SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;	Forgetting that LIMIT order matters	“LIMIT is like a doorman letting only 10 people in”	…

3️⃣ Active Recall Workflow

When you study:
	1.	New concept? Add it to the table blank except for the “Command / Concept” column.
	2.	Test yourself to fill “My Recall” without looking.
	3.	Check the real answer → fill in “Example” and “Common Mistakes”.
	4.	Create a Memory Trick — the sillier, the better.
	5.	Turn your explanation into a Content Draft (keep it short and friendly).
	6.	Review these entries later using spaced repetition (Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14).

4️⃣ How This Boosts Retention
	•	You recall before you review → strengthens memory.
	•	You teach it → forces clarity.
	•	You create content as you go → no extra work later for LinkedIn, Medium, or YouTube.
	•	You also start building your SQL portfolio of tips, which doubles as a learning log for recruiters.

5️⃣ Example for Today

Since you’re learning SELECT, *, FROM, and LIMIT, your recall session could look like:

Recall Attempt (without notes)
	•	SELECT → gets certain columns
	•		•	→ gets all columns
	•	FROM → tells which table
	•	LIMIT → shows only certain rows

Then verify, fill in examples, memory tricks, and content drafts.
